This is probably because of the small text size and these summarizers do not use synonyyms to summarize.\n","      - Synonym replacement works but the replacements with the basic nltk code seem to be uncommon words which are less likely to be used in real world scenarios. While this had potential and can be fine tuned for replacing only certain keywords in the code descriptions, but in the interest of time, this approach is also not considered and can be taken up in future.\n","    - <b>MANUAL AUGMENTATION</b> New rows were added.\n","      - Some function options like sort, read and write etc were exploded to have few possible arguments in the code. i.e. write mode can be append or ignore and hence this two rows were added for these possibilities.\n","      - Standardized columns like COL_A, COL_B, MY_ALIAS_A etc will replaced with random values in both code and comments.\n","      - Standarized Literals like LIT_STR_1, LIT_DEC_1, LIT_INT_1 will replaced with random values in both code and comments.\n","\n","    -   <b>NOTE</b>\n","      - This notebook can augment data exponentially. However, the base webscraped data is quite small due to which, augmenting some scenarios significanly might increase the data size, but it could also lead to overfitting the basic nature of the descriptions do not change a lot.\n","      - Initially agumented data up to 40K was used for training but due to compute constraints and Collab limits, the trainings were cumbersome to tune and refine.\n","      - Datasets with 20K and eventually a dataset size of 11K was selected as it was found to be less time consuming to train and tune.\n","      - Since all the selected models are ideally supposed to be trained with a huge dataset significantly, selecting a smaller subset of the training data means that we assume the risk of inaccuracies and overfitting of the models.\n","\n","----------------------------\n","<br>\n","<br>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9bzhkOdCsNDJ"},"source":["<br>\n","\n","# Import/Install Necessary
