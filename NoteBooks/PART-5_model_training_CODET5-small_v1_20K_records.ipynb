Checkpoints and necesary files are saved/copied to Google Drive. Detailed Model Evaluation/Inference/Assessment will be done in a different notebook\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","-   <b>PREPROCESS INPUT DATA</b>\n","    - Checks/Removes \\<br\\> characters from the code_snippet.\n","    - Prefixes the import_line to the code_snippet if applicable.\n","-   <b>TRAIN/EVALUATE CODET5-SMALL</b>\n","    -   Model is configured to run training loops. Early stopping is implemented if loss does not decrease after a certain number of epochs.\n","    -   Since Code Snippets and Code descriptions do not very lengthy. MAX_LENGTH for both were calculated and passed on the training separately to reduce training time.\n","    - Special tokens like \\<extra_id_0\\>, \\</s\\> sep, cls, pad were removed before evaluation.\n","    - A100 40GB GPU in Collab was used for the model training.\n","    - Below training configurations were used:\n","    <br><b>config</b> = {\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'comment_max_length'</b>: 120,\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'code_max_length'</b>: 120,\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'batch_size'</b>: 128,\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'epochs'    </b>: 20,\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'patience'  </b>: 5,\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'learning_rates'</b>: [0.000005, 0.00001, 0.00003, 0.0001, 0.0005]\n","    <br><b>&emsp;'accumulation_steps'    </b>: 1,\n","    <br>}\n","\n","- <b>OBSERVATIONS</b>\n","  - Note that the codet5-small data was trained on ~ 60 Million parameters.\n","  - The training data at ~ 20K is comparatively small. Due to compute contraints and long running training loops, this size seemed like an optimal trade-off for the current work.\n","  - Patience was kept high because Bleu Score was seen to be improving beyond a decline in validation loss. Since checkpoints were created and metrics for each iteration were captured, the appropriate model to select will be evaluated later.\n","  - Higher gradient accumulation steps were taking very long time for model evaluation and hence was adjusted back to 1\n","\n","----------------------------\n","<br>\n","<br>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UNLDKwEQi2Ls"},"outputs":[],"source":["# SET RETRAIN
